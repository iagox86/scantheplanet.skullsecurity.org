<p>Hi, welcome to <a href='https://scantheplanet.skullsecurity.org'>https://scantheplanet.skullsecurity.org</a>!</p>

<p>You're probably here because you saw this DNS entry in your logs and you're wondering what's going on.</p>

<p>I'm a security researcher, and I scan the Internet for purely research purposes. If you want to see my blog, it's at <a href='https://skullsecurity.org'>https://skullsecurity.org</a>. You can also take a look at <a href='https://infosec.exchange/@iagox86'>my Mastodon account</a> (or just google <tt>iagox86</tt>), and you'll see the kind of research I do!</p>

<p>I understand that some people don't like being scanned, though! If that's the case, please drop me an email with your IP address and I'll make sure you're opted out of all future scans. The best address to reach me is <a href='mailto:stopscanningme@skullsecurity.org'>stopscanningme@skullsecurity.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for understanding, and have a great day!</p>

<p>--Ron</p>
